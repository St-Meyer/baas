# BAAS

Baremetal as a service, or abbreviated to BAAS is a project done for the TU Delft to facilitate operating systems 
research on high-powered machines, by scheduling the access researches have to these machines. This system makes sure
each researcher can have full access to the machines in their timeslot, being able to load their own (custom) kernel and have
access to all hardware. BAAS makes sure the system is reset a well-known state after every job, to make sure these custom kernels
have not messed up the system enough to make further research on them impossible.

Disclaimer: this system is custom-built for the needs of the TU Delft. It is open source, and written to be extensible,
but it is unlikely that it will completely fit your needs without changes. We are open to pull requests, 
but we might not implement suggestions ourselves which are outside the scope of the requirements for the TU Delft.
